> SA
> VM
> VM sizes should have better selection of sizes
> should choose good order of keys in template
> should choose good order of options in dropdowns (e.g. if have an option, don't default to 'none')
> script extensions
> multiple subnets per vnet
> availability set
> network security groups
> storing infixes but displaying full names; is mildly confusing in the code since in some places we need to convert between the two (e.g. getInfixFromBlockName); should have one canonical representation ideally

> LB
> NIC should reference LB backend address pools

> should have subnets as reference-able thing; necessary if have more than 1 per vnet
> "make parameter" option and way to use parameters

> LB probe options (port, interval, number, probe url?, multiple probes)
> tcp/udp (LB, nsg's)

  > ports adhere to inequality constraints (start < end for nat rules, etc.)
  > e.g. when spitting out errors, should spit out all errors instead of just one (e.g. in LB)
