	other reasonable options based on existing resources




TODO
> VM sizes should have better selection of sizes
> should choose good order of keys in template
> should choose good order of options in dropdowns (e.g. if have an option, don't default to 'none')
> script extensions
> "make parameter" option
> add "generateForMe"
> multiple subnets per vnet
> copyIndex on all resources
> multiple LB rules
> validation: all dependencies are satisfied
> more informative names or some instructions (e.g. multiple resources will round-robin, etc.)

> VMSS boot diagnostics?
> availability set?
> probe url?
> multiple probes
> network security groups

> tcp/udp? (LB, nsg's, etc.)
> other things in templates?
  > paas things?
> error checking
  > e.g. that ports are real numbers, etc.
  > ports adhere to inequality constraints (start < end for nat rules, etc.)
  > e.g. when spitting out errors, should spit out all errors instead of just one (e.g. in LB)



> storing infixes but displaying full names; is mildly confusing in the code since in some places we need to convert between the two (e.g. getInfixFromBlockName); should have one canonical representation ideally
