TODO
> "make parameter" option
> populate <select> options
> VM sizes should have better selection of sizes
> script extensions
> multiple subnets per vnet
> copyIndex on all resources
> multiple LB rules
> validation: all dependencies are satisfied
> more informative names or some instructions (e.g. multiple resources will round-robin, etc.)

> VMSS boot diagnostics?
> availability set?
> probe url?
> multiple probes
> network security groups

> tcp/udp? (LB, nsg's, etc.)
> other things in templates?
  > paas things?
> error checking
  > e.g. that ports are real numbers, etc.
  > ports adhere to inequality constraints (start < end for nat rules, etc.)
  > e.g. when spitting out errors, should spit out all errors instead of just one (e.g. in LB)
